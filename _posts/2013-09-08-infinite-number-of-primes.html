title: There are infinte number of primes 
category: Math
---
<p>Lets assume that there are finite number of primes given by set <span class="math">\(S = \left\{  {p1, p2,....,pn}\right\} \)</span>.<br /></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>p1+p2...pn+1 is not divisible by any of those primes.<br />Let <span class="math">\(P = p1+p2...pn+1\)</span> if <span class="math">\(P\)</span> was divisible by <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in that list the <span class="math">\(p\)</span> must divide <span class="math">\(P - p1,p2,..pm=1\)</span> but <span class="math">\(p\)</span> doesnâ€™t divide <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. We have a contradiction.<br />Hence no <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in that set divides <span class="math">\(P\)</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(P = p1+p2...pn+1\)</span>, as previously stated <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is not divisible by any member of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is a new prime number which violates our intial assumption that there are only a finite set of prime numbers.</p>
