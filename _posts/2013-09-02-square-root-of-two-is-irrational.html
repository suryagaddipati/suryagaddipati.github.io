<p><span class="math">\(\sqrt 2\)</span> is irrational</p>
<p>Lets assume that <span class="math">\(\sqrt 2\)</span> is rational, meaning it can be expressed as</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are real numbers.<br />This implies,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\label{eq:solve}
    2b^2 = a^2\]</span></p>
<p>Thus <span class="math">\(a^2\)</span> is an even number which means <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is an even number, since squares of even numbers are even numbers. Since <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is an even number there exists a number <span class="math">\(c\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math">\[a= 2c\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting, <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in  [eq:solve] we get</p>
<p><span class="math">\[2b^2 = (2c)^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[2b^2 = 4c^2\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\label{eq:biseven}
    b^2 = 2c^2\]</span></p>
<p>Equation  [eq:biseven] implies that <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is an even number too. This means that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> have a common factor of <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, but <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> shouldn’t have any common factors.<br />We have a contradiction. Hence <span class="math">\(\sqrt 2\)</span> is irrational.</p>
